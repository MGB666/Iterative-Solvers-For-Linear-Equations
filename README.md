# Iterative-Solvers-For-Linear-Equations

+ This project contains Python implementations of three different iterative methods for solving linear equation systems: Jacobi method, Gauss-Seidel method, and Successive Over-Relaxation (SOR) method.

+ I have implemented these algorithms and test functions in Spyder environment then tested these in Jupyter Notebbok.

+ Jupyter Notebook also contains testing the expected error reduction per iteration step for these three algorithms. Error reduction in algorithms, shows number of iterations and amount of error at each step . Before the error value reaches 0.0 it stops and outputs the converged result.
